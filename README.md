# Agentic Fediverse

The "Agentic Fediverse" is the idea of a new kind of federation, a "second generation" iteration of the concept of federation currently
established with [ActivityPub]. It's an experiment and something that we at the [Commune](https://github.com/commune-os) group are
still trying to define more concretely.

## Tenets

We are still working on defining the core tenets of the agentic fediverse, but here is what we have so far:

1. We're envisioning a fediverse of agents, not a fediverse of servers.

## Resources

A couple of us have also written some notes / posts on the agentic fediverse:
